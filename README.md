# noExplode
Disables damage to players and fallen items/entities by Creeper & Ghast explosions.

It's kind of insane that Essentials has a convoluted config that doesn't work, and I'm not installing worldguard for this one thing.

## Installation
Drag and drop the file into the plugins folder. No configuration required. There are no commands to configure.

## Changelog
2.0.0
- Updated to Java 21
- Updated to support Minecraft 1.21.7
- Better handle of events from the two mobs
- Prevent item explosion and enable player damage
